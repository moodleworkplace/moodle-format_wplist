# Workplace list course format

This plugin was part of Moodle Workplace until version 3.11.

This is a version of the *format_wplist* plugin for Moodle Workplace 4.0 or Moodle LMS 4.0.

It is not included in the distribution of Moodle Workplace 4.0 but it can be
installed manually during or after upgrade from 3.11 to 4.0.

If you were not using this course format in Workplace 3.11, we do not recommend to install
it because standard format "Topics" looks almost the same in 4.0 and has even more
features such as course index.

Workplace list course format does not use the new course format API in 4.0 and there are
no plans to migrate to it. It will be supported for bug fixes only.
